### Hello 👋 

I am a Software Engineer who has a passion for Data Collection and Data Analysis.

If I could travel back in time, I would repeat the same actions as before to see if the outcome will be the same.
If I could go back a second time, I would want my memories erased accordingly to see if I would make the same actions as before.


# My Hobbies include:
- speed cubing
- teaching myself piano
- duolingo
